# What is [GoSplunk](https://www.gosplunk.com/)?

Why re-invent the wheel? Unless you are opposed to wasting man-hours, use a Splunk search or query that is either exactly what you want or close enough you can modify to do just what you need.

## Why use the app if the website exists?

*   Not everyone has the ability to operate on a network with constant web access. Copying SPL by hand can be a pain. This app hopes to lessen the burden of manually copying queries in from our website, and having it at your fingertips to use within your environment.

## Disclaimer

*   You will find most of these queries are not just plug-and-play. Queries are categorized in GoSplunk by sourcetype, but be sure to review the query for any fields that may break a search in your environment.

## Stuck?

*   We can help. Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fFJhGPw).

# Want to contribute?

Please consider adding your known working queries to [GoSplunk.com](https://www.gosplunk.com).

# Important Note
This app is currently in beta. Feedback is appreciated. The end-goal is to have this submitted to Splunkbase once the app is cleaned up and has a solid core functionality. Please submit a Github issue for any bugs or feature requests you want to see.
